# Google Cybersecurity - Incident Handler's Journal

This repository contains a key portfolio project from the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**, specifically from the "Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response" course. The primary artifact is the `Incident-Handler-Journal.pdf`, which showcases my ability to document, analyze, and respond to security events in a structured and professional manner.

## üìú Project Overview

The Incident Handler's Journal is a simulated work log kept by a security analyst. Its purpose is to document investigations, analyze security tools, and reflect on the incident response lifecycle. This project demonstrates a fundamental skill for any security professional: creating clear, concise, and accurate documentation that can be used for incident analysis, post-incident reviews, and knowledge sharing.

The journal follows a standardized template, capturing critical details including the **5 W's of an incident (Who, What, When, Where, Why)**, the tools used, and the relevant phases of the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle**.

## üöÄ Key Activities & Skills Demonstrated

This journal contains two detailed entries that highlight a range of critical cybersecurity skills:

### 1. Incident Response & Playbook Execution (Phishing Attack)

This entry documents the response to a simulated phishing attack that resulted in a malware payload.

* **Incident Documentation:** Captured the 5 W's to create a clear and comprehensive narrative of the attack.
* **Playbook Adherence:** Followed a structured incident response playbook to guide actions, ensuring a consistent and effective response.
* **Threat Analysis:** Analyzed the attack vector (phishing email) and the resulting impact (malware dropper) on the user's workstation.
* **NIST Lifecycle Mapping:** Correctly identified and mapped the response activities to the "Detection & Analysis" and "Containment, Eradication, & Recovery" phases of the NIST framework.

### 2. Tool Analysis: Suricata IDS

This entry focuses on the hands-on analysis of Suricata, an open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS).

* **IDS Signature Analysis:** Examined Suricata's rule files to understand the syntax and logic of its detection signatures (Action, Header, and Rule Options).
* **Log Interpretation:** Analyzed the `eve.json` log file to distinguish between security alerts and general network telemetry, and understood the importance of the `flow_id` for correlating events.
* **Command-Line Proficiency:** Utilized the Linux CLI and commands like `less` to navigate the file system and inspect configuration and log files.
* **Network Security Monitoring (NSM):** Demonstrated an understanding of how IDS tools are used for proactive network monitoring and threat detection.
